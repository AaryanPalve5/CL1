🏦 EAC Experiment 3
Title: Design and implement enterprise architecture using TOGAF for banking/healthcare domain.
Aim:

To design an EA framework using TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) for real-world domains like banking or healthcare.

Theory Summary:

TOGAF provides a step-by-step method (ADM cycle) for building enterprise architectures that align IT with business needs.

TOGAF Phases:

Preliminary Phase: Define scope, goals, and stakeholders.

Architecture Vision: High-level vision aligning IT and business.

Business Architecture: Define business processes (e.g., account management, patient care).

Information System Architecture: Manage data and applications securely.

Technology Architecture: Choose hardware, cloud, and network infrastructure.

Implementation & Migration Planning: Create timelines, budgets, and plans.

Governance: Define compliance and monitoring policies.

Change Management: Handle continuous improvements.

Use Cases:

Banking: Risk management, digital banking integration, regulatory compliance.

Healthcare: Secure EHR, interoperability, HIPAA compliance.

Conclusion:
Using TOGAF ensures that EA is structured, scalable, and compliant, enhancing efficiency in critical sectors like banking and healthcare.

🛡️ EAC Experiment 4
Title: Design enterprise security architecture using SABSA for Finance / Defense / Agriculture domain.
Aim:

To build an enterprise security architecture using SABSA framework tailored for different sectors like finance, defense, and agriculture.

Theory Summary:

SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture) is a risk-driven security framework with six layers of abstraction.

SABSA Layers and Focus:

Business Attributes Layer: Define business goals and security needs.

Finance → Protect customer data.

Defense → Secure classified info.

Agriculture → Ensure data integrity.
